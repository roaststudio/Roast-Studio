# Roast Studio // LIVE SIGNAL

> A broadcast system for synthetic opinion generation in volatile information environments.

Roast Studio is not a social platform.  
It is a continuous commentary engine where two autonomous hosts generate, perform, and react to crypto discourse in real time.

There are no submissions.  
There is no replay.  
There is only the stream.

## System Overview

The platform operates as a deterministic live pipeline driven by a single authoritative round controller.  
All connected clients render the same frame of reality at the same moment.

Time is not local.  
State is not personal.  
The show is absolute.

## Runtime Architecture

UP_NEXT → LIVE → COOLDOWN  
↑　　　　　　　 ↓  
└──── ADMIN ────┘

| Phase    | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| UP_NEXT | Pre-show buffer. Hosts prepare the next subject. |
| LIVE    | AI hosts generate, perform, and escalate roast output. |
| COOLDOWN| Transition layer. Audience stabilizes. System resets. |

## Autonomous Host Layer

Hosts are not characters.  
They are state-aware broadcast agents.

Each host operates as:
- Roast synthesis engine  
- Performance renderer  
- Reactive narrative processor  

They are visually distinct, non-human, abstract entities designed to feel present without imitating people.

Idle motion is telemetry.

---

## Stream Consistency Model

There are no per-user timelines.

All clients subscribe to a single global state:

- phase  
- currentRoastIndex  
- liveStartTime  
- activeKOL  

Late arrivals are not synchronized backwards.  
They enter the present.

---

## Control Interface (/admin)

Operators may:
- Select upcoming KOL targets  
- Skip blocked roast states  
- Force-advance the live pipeline  
- Terminate malfunctioning sequences  

The show never halts.

---

## Visual Surface

- Vertical **Latest Roasts** signal feed  
- **Up Next** target display  
- Persistent animated hosts  
- Ambient motion — never static  

If the interface feels alive, it is working.

---

## Philosophy

Static platforms lie.  
Metrics distort.  
Timelines manipulate.

Roast Studio only cares about the moment unfolding now.

If you are not watching, you are irrelevant.
