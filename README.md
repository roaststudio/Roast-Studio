# Roast Studio 🔥

Roast Studio is a live, AI-hosted crypto commentary platform where two unhinged AI hosts roast crypto personalities in real time. The show is fully automated — no submissions, no replays, no rewinds. You join the stream, or you miss it.

## What is Roast Studio?

Roast Studio is designed to feel like a live broadcast, not a web app.

Every round features a selected crypto KOL. The hosts generate and perform AI-driven roasts, react to each other, and move seamlessly from one guest to the next. All viewers see the same content at the same time.

## Philosophy

Roast Studio was built to eliminate fake engagement in crypto.

No forms.  
No vanity metrics.  
No bots pretending to care.

Just raw, live commentary — if you miss it, it’s gone.
